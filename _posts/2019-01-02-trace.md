## What is System.Net trace?

When using .NET Framework to develop application which has networking capabilities, often network traces are needed to understand what is happening inside of your production environment.

We have detailed official documentations on MSDN about how to [Configure Network Tracing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/how-to-configure-network-tracing). In short, you can enable tracing through application's config file, or machine-wide `machine.config`.

## When/Why do we need to collect circular traces?

As a memeber of System.Net team, I have seen multiple reports from customers (internal/external) that their production servers have high loads, and the logs are growing to GBs in a matter of seconds! So a circular trace is highly desired in this situation, and I will share the steps to do it.

## Steps to collect

One way to limit the log size is using **System.Diagnostics.EventLogTraceListener** to write the trace output to event log, instead of a text file - Event logs have their own mechanism for limiting growth.

1. Create a new event source during the installation of your application(if creating the source during installation is not an option, then try to create the source well ahead of the first write operation, perhaps during your application initialization). If you choose this approach, be sure your initialization code is running with administrator rights on the computer. These rights are required for creating new event sources[^1]. Here is the sample code:
```c#
if (!EventLog.SourceExists("MySource"))
{
    EventLog.CreateEventSource("MySource", "MyNewLog");
                
    // The source is created. Exit the application to allow it to be registered. 
    return;
}
```

2. Change the type of logging in *this part* of the `app.config` file to EventLogTraceListener:
![MyNewLog](\assets\post_pics\trace.png)

3. Start application, wait for reaching the states you want to analyze.

4. Open Event Viewer -> Applications and Services Logs -> MyNewLog. System.Net trace is store here.
![MyNewLog](\assets\post_pics\trace1.png)

5. Right click MyNewLog -> Property. Set below properties to limit the log size.
![MyNewLog](\assets\post_pics\trace2.png)

6. The log's location is indicated in `Log path` variable.

Now you successfully collect the circular System.Net traces!
