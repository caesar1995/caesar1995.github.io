## Necessary steps
### Alias the remote

Taking the [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx){:target="_blank"} repo for example:

```
git remote add dotnet https://github.com/dotnet/corefx.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourUserName>/corefx.git
```

"dotnet" refers to the remote GitHub repo of the original dotnet repo (i.e. corefx).
"origin" refers to the remote GitHub repo of the fork of the dotnet repo stored user a dev's server account.

### Update Local Clone and Server-Based Fork
```
git checkout master
git pull dotnet master
git push [--set-upstream origin master]  // only once per repo
```

### Update feature branch in local clone with latest changes from others in the master branch
```
git checkout <mybranch>
git fetch dotnet
git rebase dotnet/master
```

### Squash commits
```
git rebase -i master
```

An editor will open. The typical rebase is to leave the first line unchanged and mark the following commits with "s" (squash), however you can do more complicated rebasing than simply squashing.

Git will reapply the changes over the root branch: you may need to Resolve merge conflicts and enter: 

```
git rebase --resume.
```
